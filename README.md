# DATA-STRUCTURE-SORTING-ALGORITHM

RAILWAY SYSTEM MANAGEMENT (mini project)

Data Structures is the way of arranging the data, so as to access the data in a feasible manner. 
Our project deals with Learning and Understanding the concept of different types of sorting 
techniques for the purpose of implementing in the real world problems. The different sorting 
algorithms like bubble, selection, Insertion and Bin-Sort are used to implement the various 
functions for the Railway Management System.
In this project we will implement Four Modules: Implement sorting of Train numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm, Implement sorting of Train names using Selection sort algorithm, Implement sorting of passenger names (travelling in a train) using Insertion Sort algorithm and Implement sorting of Station names using Bin-sort algorithm.
By this project of using different sorting techniques in the Railway Management System it is very easy to find a train number or train name or passenger name or station name from a lot of data available easily because everything will be sorted.
